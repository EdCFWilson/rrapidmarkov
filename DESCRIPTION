Description: Takes a set of transition probabilities and calculates the Markov
    trace (i.e. proportions of cohort in each state at eact time period), then
    applies values to each (eg costs, health state utilities) for use in 
    health economic evaluations / cost-effectiveness or cost-utility analyses.
    The package is built as a 'no-frills' approach, with a focus on 
    computational speed, thus is quite efficient for probabilistic analyses.
